	<p>My drawing journey. I don't know why you interested with this, but I hope you will enjoy this journal, because I definitely do.</p>
	<h1>The Anime and MS Paint Era</h1>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/1.png" class="responsive-image">	
		<p>I believe it's all started since 2009-ish, but I only started to make a digital copy on around 2011-ish.</p>
		<p>I used to watch Japanese cartoon, and undoubtly it's influenced my drawing. It's mostly look like edgy cold-looking-anime-protagonist-guy because I've seen a lot of Detective Conan, Tantei Yakumo, or such, that gave an idea of being know about any information, and try to deliver that information in such "cool" style, is cool.</p>
		<p>Sometimes I also try to draw some "beauty" scenery that came through my mind, but I mostly did it in class, which is the reason I draw them on book paper.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/2.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>I've been trying to search my own style. Also, just like any other kids that wanna make their own world, I create some characters, their lore, etc. etc. because that's fun. However, I began to down desperately when digital art got more opportunity to be widely seen by the world. Because ... well, they look better at that time? So, that's when I try to draw digitally. I'm not doing it for the long time because: 1. I don't have any sufficent material. My computer was ancient (even at that time) and it'll off automatically because of overheat. I also only have mouse, which is pretty hard to control without any good software; 2. I'm being impatient. So I try to draw on Microsoft Paint, which ... well, turned out bad. I can't even draw in manga style properly.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/3.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>That's when I decided to go back to traditional drawing and find something new. Turned out that I enjoy drawing realistic portrait.</p>

	<h1>Attempt of Realistic Portrait and Shading Era</h1>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/4.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>It's laughable and I won't deny it. The artworks are from end of 2011 to new 2012, probably. I spent so much time on drawing at this time. I remember, the first thing I did when I came home from school is drawing, and spent like 2 to 3 hours just to make one portrait. Eventually, those 2 to 3 hours was expanded to more than 5 hours.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/5.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>Those are from 2012. However, you may notice I'm super duper rare to draw a female figure, because, well, it's really hard for me. I never take any art classes, nor seriously spend my time just to study the characteristic features. Everytime I tried to draw a female, I always failed no matter what. So, yeah, that's very unfortunate.</p>
		<p>After I spent some times with realistic portrait, I also try to draw with my imagination, so I blend the cartoon style with some realism shading.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/6.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>And that's how I started realistic portrait drawing (and do some colouring beibah).</p>

	<h1>Experimental 1: Microsoft Excel</h1>
		<p>Beside of that, I also like to experimenting. The first one is with Microsoft Excel, because the existence of digital drawing still bugging me. I've been a friend to some crazy awesome artists at this time, but they gradually shifted from traditional art to digital art. So, this is when I tried to come back to digital drawing, just to follow the trend.</p>
		<p>Trying to find a good software for me to use, I accidentally found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y-Zm7k9-c">Shukei's speedpainting video</a>, which inspired me a lot to create an art with limited tools. That's when I started to experimenting on drawing.</p>

	<h1>Experimental 2: Negative Drawing</h1>
		<p>Negative drawing is fun, and probably the most fun and longest experiment I ever did. I don't remember how I know about this kind of drawing, but I believe I started it around 2014, because I remember I draw Antonio Banderas and Altair for my first negative drawing, and the pictures say 2014</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/11.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>If you ask how I did that, I will say I was cheating a bit. Sometimes I look through my phone with negative filter camera because I'm afraid my work will be too off, Especially when I did non-greyscale portrait. But at least I don't use AI, right?</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/12.png" class="responsive-image">
		<br>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/13.png" class="responsive-image">
		<br>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/14.png" class="responsive-image">		
		<p>One reason why I like negative drawing is because I don't need that messy black charcoal to draw a very sharp black shade. I draw on regular drawing paper, not a canvas, so sometimes that's become a trouble.</p>

	<h1>Experimental 3: Mathematics Expression</h1>
		<p>When I took numerical analysis course, lagrange interpolation is one of the subject I learned. Then, there's an idea: I can draw a curve along the fixed point with lagrange formula, then I should be able to draw a portrait with super smooth curve. And, yes, it works.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/15.png" class="responsive-image">
		<p>The idea was very simple, but it's very effective to trick your friend, made them thinking it's involving some complex magical mechanism just because there's math in it.</p>
		<p>I also do some dense family line function to make a drawing.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/16.png" class="responsive-image">

	<h1>Experimental 4: Live Drawing</h1>
		<p>I enjoy live drawing. Spending some times just to capture the environment around you on paper is refreshing. Unfortunately, I lost most of them because my friend borrow my sketch book, but didn't return it to me. Fortunately, I separate my "live drawing" sketch book with the others, because I prefer to draw my "live drawing" on A5, unlike the other. These are my "live drawing" work I can find.</p>
		<img src="./Image/Drawing/17.png" class="responsive-image">

	<h1>College and After Era</h1>
		<p>I still drawing sometimes, but never made it to 12 hours perartwork like before. It's dropped drastically when I was in college because of the limited time that I had. However, please enjoy!</p>
