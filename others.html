	<p>Hmm, what should I write here? Oh, right, this is others section, so I can write everything I want, right? How about I spill everything I like here?</p>
	<h1>BOOKS</h1>
		<p>I won't say I'm the most passionate book reader because I didn't read a book a week like most people do, but I do read sometimes. It's all started when my parents bought me weekly <a href="https://bobo.grid.id/">Bobo magazine</a>, which lead me to bought my own novel from saving at very young age. Not a very good experience though, because the novel was actually for adult audience (not in sexual terms). I don't understand how the store clerk let me buy it when I was clearly under ten years old that time, but what happened happened.</p>
		<p>Beside college textbook, all of my books are fictional novel. When I'm in a store, I usually looking through mystery crime section, then sci-fi section. If you ask me what are my favourite books, I will point them to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/44928-dexter">Dexter series</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833670-dark-matter">Dark Matter</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</a> for now. If you ask me who are my favourite writers, then I will say <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/442240.Blake_Crouch">Blake Crouch</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4178.Cormac_McCarthy">Cormac McCharty</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/782252.Rio_Haminoto">Rio Haminoto</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5817614.Ayu_Welirang">Ayu Welirang</a>. By the way, I also like classic works such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis">The Methamorphosis</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland">Flatland</a>.</p>
	<h1>MOVIES</h1>
		<p>Well, who don't enjoy movies? I can enjoy movies from silent era to modern one. I like hollywood type movies as I like arthouse films which may be too boring for some people. Also, since I watched <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-show-must-go-on-2010/">The Show Must Go On</a>, I began my interest to watch movies from every country, even though I will only watch one I interested in.</p>
		<p>I'm mostly interested in crime/thriller movie, but doesn't mean I hate everything else. I also have specific interest in lone/isolated/bleak small town setting. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/a-dark-place-2018/"> A Dark Place</a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/police-adjective/">Police, Adjective</a> are the example for "that kind" arthouse film. If you wanna more action, then <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2618986/">Wayward Pines series</a> will illustrate how I like the setting without make you sleepy (The novels are good too by the way). If you ask me who are my favourite director and actor, then I will choose <a href="https://letterboxd.com/director/yury-bykov/">Yury Bykov</a> for director and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/actor/navid-mohammadzade/">Navid Mohammadzadeh</a> for actor. If you ask me what are my favourite movies from classic black and white era, those will be <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-phantom-carriage/">The Phantom Carriage</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/i-am-a-fugitive-from-a-chain-gang/">I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</a>, and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/sweet-smell-of-success/">Sweet Smell of Success</a></p>
	<h1>LANGUAGES</h1>
		<p>In Indonesia, you'll most likely grow as trilingual: Indonesian, English, and a regional language. Indonesian is mandatory because that's the official language. English is taught in school since that's the widely used international language. Regional language grow up naturally based from where you grow up. In my case, I speak Sundanese as regional language. So, I can confidently say I speak three languages (by default, lol).</p>
		<p>I learned Japanese in Highschool, but already forgotten most of it. I started learning Spanish since most of mi vídeo juego amigos are from spanish speaking country. I'm interested in Armenian and sometimes writing nonsense like սա for no reason because some Armenian movies. I can read cyrillic, unfortunately I won't understand 99.99% of it.</p>
		<p>Learning new languages is not an easy task for me, especially if nobody speak that language around you. However, if someone ask something on the internet and I can reply it with my limited vocabulary from their native language, I will try my best to do that. Probably bias, but people seems happy when foreigner try speaking their language. That's always makes me happy and that's the point for me learning other languages. So, now I'll say, բարև Հայաստան։</p>
	<h1>GAMES</h1>
		<p>I play games, but mostly single player games. I don't do much multiplayer games because high ping and delayed action is stressful. My choice usually goes to survival games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323190/Frostpunk/">Frostpunk</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/815370/Green_Hell/">Green Hell</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/">Project Zomboid</a>. However, I also like calm casual games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">Stardew Valley</a>. I used to play a lot of rhythm games, mostly VSRG, but finger stiffness around 2022 made my movements slower. I don't quit entirely, but I don't play much rhythm games anymore.</p>
		<p>If you ask me what are my favourites video games, it'll be hard for me to pick. However, beside the one I already mention above, I usually put <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect Trilogy</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108710/Alan_Wake/">Alan Wake</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174180/Red_Dead_Redemption_2/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7937/This_Is_the_Police_Bundle/">This is the Police duology</a> on top. I don't have console beside broken PS 1, so I don't know any games except the one that released for PC.</p>
		<p>I also played board games, but I'm not the one that enjoy spending a lot of time on board game cafe. Whenever I can, I usually supply my board game for the party, so we are not limited in space nor time (there's even a time I played straight all night with them without sleeping). If you ask what are my favourite board games are, then I'll enthusiastly say I love legacy mechanics. If it's not available, then I usually pick strategy coop games like <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic">Pandemic</a>.</p>
	<h1>MUSIC</h1>
		<p>Music is life yas. Again, I don't have any specific like or dislike as long as it sounds good. I do hear casual ballad such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUtAe5PUKtE">Gary Jules' cover of Mad World</a> to something crazy like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6361EXrvUAQ">Pictured as Perfect by Frums</a> (I blame rhythm game for it).</p>
		<p>If you ask me who are my favourite singer, then I will say <a href="http://www.ivetamukuchyan.com/">Iveta Mukuchyan</a>, <a href="https://www.juanes.net/">Juanes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kaarijaofficial">Käärijä</a>, and <a href="https://iwanfals.co.id/">Iwan Fals</a>. If you ask me who are my favourite band, I will say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialClutch">Clutch</a>, <a href="https://poetsofthefall.com/">Poets of the Fall</a>, <a href="https://animaljazz.com/">Animal Jazz</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr6JvSsmkveXFYat6xYRQ3w">EdanE</a>. If you ask me who are my favourite composer, then I will say <a href="https://cametek.jp/">Camellia</a>, <a href="https://www.ibrahimmaalouf.com/en/">Ibrahim Maalouf</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/48U18kGe2oZCcU0HddFnCP">Dax Johnson</a>, and <a href="http://www.frums.xyz/">Frums</a>. There's a lot more than that, but those are the first row of names appeared in my head.</p>
		<p>Oh, and by the way, I also compose piano score. It's not like I'm good with instrument (heck I can't even play guitar), but designing game actually force me to do it. I don't wanna be a game developer who steal some paid material, including song and music, so I learn it myself to cut the budget. I'm lucky though since my games are usually around puzzle or story driven crime mystery genre, so it suits the simplicity yet elegant single piano composition. If you're wondering, here is one of my work that I'm really proud of! It's created for the main menu of one of my game.</p>
        		<audio controls>
            			<source src="./Audio/Others/Totally_Bose_Mesner.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        		</audio>
		<p>I haven't create much song, so I won't make any separated section for it. Maybe in the future? Well, just maybe, in case I keep making them.</p>
	<h1>PUZZLES</h1>
		<p>My first interest in puzzle actually began at around 2006, when my older brother introduce Sudoku to me. There's one newspaper which present sudoku puzzle for every weekend, and I tried to solve them as much as I can. However, I was burned out at how repetitive it to be, since they only serve classic sudoku. I'm not even sure if they are computer-generated or not, but my gut say so.</p>
		<p>I never thought about puzzle much more until mid 2019 came. One of my friend host a small online pencil and paper puzzle contests, called Kompetisi Puzzle Klasik (en: Classic Puzzle Competition) and ask my help to announce it on a forum I managed. I finally decided to join as participant.</p>
		<p>I remember Slitherlink being the first foreign puzzle I ever learned. I even searched online puzzle material to learn it. Now I'm exposed to a lot of puzzle with Tapa, Country Road, and Ripple Effect being my favourite. I have special place of hatred toward arithmetic puzzles like Japanese Sums and Kakuro tho :D</p>
		<p>I like competitive puzzling, but I can't find any local association that facilitate puzzle contests, so I still stick with online contest, even though I'm hoping on doing some on-site contest. In 2021, I, with my friend that introduce me to puzzle, held pencil and paper puzzle contest that opened for international player. Probably the biggest steps we ever did. You can go to <a href="puzzle.html">PUZZLE</a> section to see more of it. That being said, I'm doing puzzle for fun now.</p>
