    <p>You made it here, so welcome!</p>
    <p>My name is Andri. Some online presence address me as Sanusi/Nusi. There's a long story to be told about that shifted nickname, but you can call me either of them.</p>
    <p>Looking through the past, I've been thinking about archiving some of my activity. So, I finally decided to make this very simple page. Mostly because I'm not good with memory. If you know me IRL, you probably have heard the story, about how I neglected a whole class just because I'm trying too hard to remember my friend's name when I wanna borrow her correction pen. However, then I asked myself, "Why not make it semi-portofolio diary?"</p>
    <p>I have some hobbies. Some are probably you want to find out, some are probably not. Compressing everything on single page or media looks like a mess, so you can navigate everything about me as you wish with below links.</p>
